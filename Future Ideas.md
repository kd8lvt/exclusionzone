- Configurable Magnum Torch
  - Allow selecting a specific mob/set of mobs to be prevented from spawning
  - Eg. Allow all hostile mobs but creepers, or allow only passive mobs
  - Also, a configurable range between 1 and 64-or-so blocks. Idk. Balance is hard.
  - Vanilla Compat options for the configuring part, because lord knows that'll be a pain
    - A configuration item that can switch modes between the mob types & tags?
      - Upside: it's flexible and can be used for other blocks in the future
      - Downside: it's clunky
    - A filter based on mob drops??? It'd be done in a crafting table? I guess?
      - Upside: Less clunky than a wrench-like item
      - Downside: Less flexible than the config item. Probably also would be more difficult to make work for other future blocks
    - Or maybe you rclick the magnum torch on the mob to allow/deny, shift-rclick for tag?
      - Upside: Intuitive-ish and doesn't require an additional item
      - Downside: Requires an example of the mob/tag you want to configure at the time of configuring
