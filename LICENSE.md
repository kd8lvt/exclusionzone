Exclusion Zone is licensed under the terms of an adapted version of [the Botania License](https://botaniamod.net/license.html) (I just like it.)

The adapted version is as follows:

KD8LVT's Adapted Botania License

All of kd8lvt's (The Author, kd8lvt, or Kd) projects (The Projects, The Project, or simply Project) - including mods, websites, design documents, etc. are distributed under this reasonably open license.  

You probably want to have a read through the following if you want to do something with The Projects outside interacting as a typical consumer.  
You are completely free and have the right to Use, Share and Adapt any of The Projects. These rights can not be removed from you as long as follows the license terms, and you are even _encouraged_ to do so.  
If you simply wish to play with The Projects and do nothing else, go for it, this document does not apply to you.

# General Clauses
Clauses that apply in general to any of the uses that follow.

### Personal Permission Clause
The Author **will not** give personal permission, unless they know the person asking or there's a good reason for it, as giving personal permission implies endorsement.  
Asking for personal permission will likely just end up having you ignored or redirected back to this document.

### Waive Clause
All restrictive clauses in this license can be ignored with personal permission from The Author. Read the above clause.

### Extensive Clause
This license applies to all of The Projects, as well as any of the following:
- associated websites
- related code
- related assets
- binaries built from the above  

This clause does **NOT** apply if otherwise indicated, or when there is a reasonable doubt that The Author has legal right to claim ownership of the asset in question.  
(For example, the Exclusion Zone Guster Jar's [legacy texture](https://github.com/kd8lvt/exclusionzone/blob/b2b083331c453b854cf4321f78c85aacabe00841/src/main/resources/assets/exclusionzone/textures/item/guster_jar.png) is owned by Nintendo.)

## Informal Clause
This license will not hold up in court.  
I have no intention of suing anyone for breaking it, the worst that can happen to you if you do is that I'll get annoyed and ask you to rectify your mistake.  
If you use a public distribution platform (such as CurseForge or Modrinth) it's also possible your project will get taken down. Breaking the license also makes you a jerk, and you don't want to be a jerk, do you?

# If you want to Distribute any of The Projects
"Distribution" refers to making available binaries, assets, or source of the mod available from the original sources as part of your modpack or otherwise.

### Attribution Clause
You must give appropriate credit to Kd as the creator of The Project, or the parts of it you're using.   
If you perform any alterations, the fact that you do so should also be indicated.  
A link to the original source is optional, but it would be appreciated if you would do so.

### Non-Monetary Clause
You may not charge for access to the distribution itself or gain money through it. This also includes any type of inline advertisement, such as url shorteners (adf.ly or otherwise) or ads in your service.  
Additionally, this clause disallows restricting any amount of access behind a paywall. Charging for ingame goods such as mod items or cosmetic features on a server does _not_ count as distribution and falls purely under the [Minecraft Usage Guidelines](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines) laid out by Mojang.

# If you want to Feature any of The Projects
"Featuring" refers to using The Projects in a public environment where you do not distribute binaries, assets, or sources.  
An example would be a video you upload to YouTube, or if you were to stream your gameplay to a livestreaming service like Twitch.

### Thief Clause
You must not claim that you made any of The Projects. Giving appropriate credit to The Author as the creator of The Projects makes you cooler, but you don't have to do it if you don't want to.


# If you want to Use The Projects' Code or Assets
Usage of code or assets falls under the Extensive Clause.

### External Clause
Certain parts of the codebase are indicated to be licensed under alternative licenses. You must obey those licenses.

### Attribution Clause
You must give appropriate credit to The Author as the creator of The Projects, or the parts of it you're using.  
If you make any alterations, the fact that you do so should also be indicated.  
A link back to the original source is optional, but it would be appreciated if you would do so.

### Copyleft Clause
Your project must be open source (have its source visible and allow for redistribution and modification) and include a clause similar to this one in its license.

### API Clause
Any of the other clauses under this section do **not** apply to any of The Project's API code (the subdirectory src/main/java/com/kd8lvt/&lt;modid&gt;/api).  
However, if The Project's API code is used, it *must* be included *exactly* as it was when obtained. (The exception being comments; feel free to comment my code. Heck, you can submit a PR with exclusively comments, if you want.)
